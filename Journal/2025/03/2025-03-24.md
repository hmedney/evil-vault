- Purged independent watchdogs across the government who investigate corruption and abuse.
- Stacked the most powerful offices with personal loyalists.
- Called on those same loyalists to investigate and prosecute his opponents.
- Undermined the freedom of the press.
- Retaliated against lawyers who have opposed him in court.
- Defied and threatened Federal judges.
